# ConsoleDungeonGame
⚔️ Console Dungeon game for my EBC-ZOO - Basics of Object Oriented Design course.

## About the Project
This project represents my attempt to create a text-based dungeon-crawling game using C++. The creation of this game was part of my university course, 
involving fundamental object-oriented design principles and the integration of well-known design patterns into the code.

## Game Features
In this text-based adventure, players explore a dynamically generated dungeon map. Taking on the role of a witcher, the main character, players navigate through the underground labyrinth, 
battling various foes, including guards and monsters. The protagonist can utilize both weapons and magical abilities in combat. The witcher's health depletes with each encounter, 
underscoring the importance of tactical decisions in battle. The ultimate objective: defeat all enemies and find the exit from the dungeon.

## Key Elements

- **Health Management:** The protagonist's health is limited, emphasizing the significance of tactical choices during combat encounters.

- **Game Saving:** Save your progress mid-game, allowing for later resumption and continuation of the adventure.

- **Customization:** Tailor your gaming experience by choosing the map size for a new game.

- **Random Distribution:** Enemies and various bonuses are distributed randomly across the map, making each game unique.
